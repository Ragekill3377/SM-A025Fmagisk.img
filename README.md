# SM-A025Fmagisk.img
For Samsung galaxy A02s, magisk patched AP file full, not just boot.img. For Rooting
1. your warranty gone
2. if phone gets soft bricked, i am not responsible. fix the softbrick by downloading phone stock firmware from sammobile.com.
3. this will root your device using magisk. i have a SM-A02s Pakistani. even though you could do it manually, i decided to make it for you.
4. The file is too big to be shared on github, so i will provide a google drive link.
5. i also fixed the partioning size issue, where it may show only 8gb of space.( already patched )
